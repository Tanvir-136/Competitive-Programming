# <font color="blue">Competitive-Programming</font>

Welcome to my <font color="green">`Competitive Programming`</font> journey! In this repository, I share my daily <font color="green">`code`</font> submissions and solutions to various competitive programming problems from different online platforms.

## <font color="orange">About</font>

Competitive programming is a mind sport that involves solving well-defined problems using programming skills. This repository serves as a record of my progress, challenges, and solutions encountered during my <font color="green">`competitive programming`</font> journey.

## <font color="purple">Folder Structure</font>

- **Ratting wise**: Contains folders organized by <font color="green">`Ratting`</font>, each containing the code submissions for the challenges solved on that day.

## <font color="red">Usage</font>

Feel free to explore the code and solutions provided in this repository. You can browse through the daily challenges or search for specific problems by category or platform. If you find any errors, have suggestions, or want to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
