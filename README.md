# <span style="color:blue">Competitive-Programming</span>

Welcome to my <span style="color:green">`Competitive Programming`</span> journey! In this repository, I share my daily <span style="color:green">`code`</span> submissions and solutions to various competitive programming problems from different online platforms.

## <span style="color:orange">About</span>

Competitive programming is a mind sport that involves solving well-defined problems using programming skills. This repository serves as a record of my progress, challenges, and solutions encountered during my <span style="color:green">`competitive programming`</span> journey.

## <span style="color:purple">Folder Structure</span>

- **Ratting wise**: Contains folders organized by <span style="color:green">`Ratting`</span>, each containing the code submissions for the challenges solved on that day.

## <span style="color:red">Usage</span>

Feel free to explore the code and solutions provided in this repository. You can browse through the daily challenges or search for specific problems by category or platform. If you find any errors, have suggestions, or want to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
